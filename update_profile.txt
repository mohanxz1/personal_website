To update the profile picture:

1. Save the uploaded photo as "profile.jpg" in the webforport folder
2. The photo should replace the existing profile.jpg file
3. The website will automatically display the new photo in a circular frame

The current profile image system is already set up to:
- Display the image in a perfect circle
- Provide a fallback with "MRM" initials if the image fails to load
- Maintain responsive design across all devices

Once you save the new photo as profile.jpg, refresh the website to see your actual photo displayed!
